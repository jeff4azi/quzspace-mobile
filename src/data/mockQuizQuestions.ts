  {
    id: 'q-1',
    question: 'What is the primary function of the 3-way handshake in TCP connection setup?',
    options: [
      'To encrypt all transmitted payload packets',
      'To synchronize sequence numbers and establish a reliable full-duplex session',
      'To compress data headers before transmission over routers',
      'To allocate static IP addresses to client interfaces',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'TCP 3-Way Handshake',
    explanation:
      'The TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) synchronizes initial sequence numbers (ISNs) between client and server to establish a reliable, full-duplex connection before data transmission begins.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-2',
    question: 'In CIDR notation /26, how many usable host IP addresses are available on the subnet?',
    options: [
      '64 usable hosts',
      '62 usable hosts',
      '32 usable hosts',
      '30 usable hosts',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'Subnet Mask Calculations',
    explanation:
      'A /26 subnet leaves 6 bits for hosts (32 - 26 = 6). 2^6 = 64 total IP addresses. Subtracting 2 reserved addresses (network ID and broadcast ID) leaves 62 usable host IPs.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-3',
    question: 'Which Layer of the OSI model is responsible for packet routing across multiple networks?',
    options: [
      'Layer 2 - Data Link Layer',
      'Layer 3 - Network Layer',
      'Layer 4 - Transport Layer',
      'Layer 7 - Application Layer',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'OSI Model Layers',
    explanation:
      'Layer 3 (Network Layer) handles logical IP addressing and packet routing across interconnected networks using protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-4',
    question: 'What type of DNS query forces the DNS server to return the final IP address or an error, rather than a referral pointer?',
    options: [
      'Iterative query',
      'Recursive query',
      'Reverse lookup query',
      'Authoritative query',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'DNS Resolution',
    explanation:
      'In a recursive DNS query, the client requests that the DNS resolver perform all necessary queries on its behalf and return either the final IP address or a failure error.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-5',
    question: 'What mechanism does TCP Flow Control use to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver?',
    options: [
      'AIMD Congestion Window',
      'Sliding Receiver Window (rwnd)',
      'Slow Start Threshold (ssthresh)',
      'Fast Retransmit Timer',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'Flow Control vs Congestion Control',
    explanation:
      'TCP Flow Control uses the Advertised Receiver Window (rwnd) size contained in TCP header acknowledgments to throttle the sender based on available receiver buffer space.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-6',
    question: 'Which transport layer protocol provides connectionless, unacknowledged data delivery with minimum overhead?',
    options: ['TCP', 'UDP', 'ICMP', 'BGP'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'Transport Protocols',
    explanation:
      'UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that transmits datagrams without setup handshakes, sequence numbers, or delivery acknowledgments.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-7',
    question: 'What PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is created at Layer 4 (Transport) when data is encapsulated?',
    options: ['Frame', 'Packet', 'Segment', 'Bit stream'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 2,
    topic: 'OSI Encapsulation',
    explanation:
      'At Layer 4 (Transport), application data is divided and wrapped with transport headers (port numbers, sequence numbers) to form a Segment (or Datagram for UDP).',
  },
  {
    id: 'q-8',
    question: 'Which algorithm is used by TCP Congestion Control during initial connection startup to probe available bandwidth?',
    options: [
      'Fast Recovery',
      'Slow Start',
      'Congestion Avoidance',
      'Selective Acknowledgment',
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    topic: 'Congestion Control',
    explanation:
      'TCP Slow Start exponentially doubles the congestion window (cwnd) every RTT starting from 1 MSS until it reaches the slow-start threshold (ssthresh) or packet loss occurs.',
  },
